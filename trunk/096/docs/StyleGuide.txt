Naming Conventions:
-------------------

FileNames:
The letter of the first word is lowercase, while the first letter of each additional
word is capitalized. This naming convention is known as camelCase. All file extensions
are lowercase.
	Examples:
		npcBackpack.inc
		myIncludeFle.inc
		showAll.src

	Exceptions:
		Commands are all lowercase.
		Core files are all lowercase.


Variables:
	Examples:
		var my_integer;
		var my_string;
		var layer_array;
                       
	Exceptions:
		Constant variables are all capitalized and words are separated
		using the underscore character '_'.
                       
		const MY_CONSTANT := 10.0;
		const NUMBER_OF_GUARDS := 100;

	Properties:
		object.someproperty := 100;


Functions:
All functions use the PascalCase convention, which as you can see has the first
letter of each word capitalized.
	Examples:
		function ListOnlineDrow(who)
		function GetLastName(who, num_of_letters)
	Methods:
		object.MethodFunction(arguments)
                      
	Exceptions:
		If the function/s is part of a special package it can include a small
		prefix to define its origin i.e. AI_GetNerves(mobile).


Programs:
All programs are named after the file in which they are contained. Unlike their filenames
though, the can either follow the 'cameCasing' or 'PascalCasing'.
	Examples:
		(FileName is "bardInstruments.src"), thus the program is named:
		program bardInstruments(item)

		(FileName is "enumerateTowns.src), thus the program is named:
		program EnumerateTowns(who, uX, uY, lX, lY, realm)

	Exceptions:
		There are certain exceptions with special kind of programs, such as commands
		i.e. command_MyCommand(who, params) or textcmd_
		or a spell program
		i.e. spell_GreaterHeal(who)



Other Formatting:

	if ( something )
		Code here;
	endif

	case ( something )
	     	value:
		     	code;
		     	break;
     		default:
     			code;
     			break;
     	endcase

	while ( something )
		code here;
		sleepms(2);
	endwhile

	do
		codehere;
		sleepms(2);
	while ( case );
	
	foreach iteration in ( iterated )
		codehere;
		sleepms(2);
	endforeach
	
	for ( i; i <= 4; i:=i+1 )
		codehere;
		sleepms(2);
	endfor
	
	for ( ( i:=1 ) to ( value ) )
		codehere;
		sleepms(2);
	endfor
	
	var math := 4 + 3 * 10;
	var string := "Hello there "+"Stephen."+" I am "+math+" years old.";
	var value := SomeFunction(argument_1, argument_2);
