Notes:
Never use GetObjProperty, SetObjProperty, EraseObjProperty and GetObjPropertyNames.
Use GetProperty, SetProperty, EraseProperty and GetPropertyNames from properties.inc instead.
This is for security reasons.

Avoid using SendSysMessage and Broadcast. Use SendMessage and SendAll from
messages.inc instead.
This allows players to use custom colors for every kind of message.
