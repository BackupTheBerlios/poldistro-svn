    <p>There is no real documentation outside of the package itself. However, 
    the package itself, in the code, is pretty well documented. So it shouldn't 
    be that hard to figure out what exactly is going on. </p>
    <font SIZE="4"></font>
    <p>The AI_Brain package is basically a package that uses dictionaries for 
    it's database of scripts, and messages to know which ones to call and to 
    receive instruction from those scripts. </p>
    <p>At it's heart, the brain.src script is your one true &quot;npc script&quot;. It 
    includes an include which includes npc.em, and it is the script which does 
    all direct communication with the npc reference. It is also generic enough 
    that you should really never have to touch it for the most part. It 
    basically receives events from the npc object and uses those to determine 
    which scripts it will start off. Those scripts are started, and the events 
    appropriate to that script are passed along to it by the brain. That script 
    operates more or less independently, having received initially a structure 
    with the npc reference in it, and the event that started it off. If you 
    process events within that script, you will receive the events that the 
    brain is forwarding along to your script. In order to &quot;command&quot; the npc to 
    do things, your script usually includes npc_commands.inc. This is a set of 
    functions which basically packages up an event for each type of standard 
    npc.em function, and sends an event for each one off to the brain. The brain 
    processes these events, and executes the appropriate npc.em functionality.
    </p>
    <p>That is a basic understanding of what it is all about, and if you look at 
    brain.src and the various include files when appropriate, you should be able 
    to see all of this taking place and put it all together as to exactly how it 
    is happening. The brain package is a little less efficient than typical AI, 
    and it can also run into problems if the event queue's get clogged with 
    messages. But it's true glory is in it's generic encapsulation. With it, you 
    can have a bunch of npc's that are very similar except, perhaps, use 
    different combat scripts, and all you have to do is write the individual 
    combat scripts, rather than having to re-write an entirely new AI script. 
    The old AI scripts could be approached similarly once you understood the 
    various nested includes, but they were far more convoluted and difficult to 
    follow than the brain's method. But also keep in mind that seperate scripts 
    offers the flexibility(and complexity) of doing things relatively 
    independently of having to worry about the main AI. So, for instance, the 
    brain will send combat events to the combat script, and that is what will 
    keep your npc fighting, following, etc, but it will still also send speech 
    events to the listen script. So your npc can be fighting, and talking, at 
    the same time, without having to include &quot;talking logic&quot; within the combat 
    code. With the standard AI, you would either have an NPC that didn't speak 
    while fighting, or one that had to have that code imbedded not only in the 
    main AI loop, but also the combat loop. With the brain AI, the brain fires 
    off events to the appropriate scripts, starting off the scripts if 
    necessary, and those scripts run independantly of one another(unless you 
    make them rely on each other for some reason, or in some manner).</p>
    <p>While adding some overhead to AI in it's pre-processing of events and 
    multiple scripts to handle them, the brain package does provide quite a bit 
    of easy flexibility to make your npc a little easier to manage.</p>
    <hr noshade color="#000000" size="1">
    <p>Brain_AI is an &quot;AI system&quot; that is very different architecturally from 
    the current distro AI. So far as I understand, it is the only other released 
    AI system for POL, although undoubtably other people have written their own 
    from ground up and just not released them.</p>
    <p>It attempts, and often succeeds, at taking the highly convoluted and 
    complex task of operating your NPC's and makes that task into a fairly 
    modular approach. In doing so, it makes alot of things much easier and even 
    simply doable. </p>
    <p>You really have to probably pick it up for yourself however and try it 
    out. It can work fine right along side of the distro AI, so you can just 
    create a new NPC in npcdesc.cfg which uses the brain_AI to control it. So 
    give it a try is the best advice.</td>
