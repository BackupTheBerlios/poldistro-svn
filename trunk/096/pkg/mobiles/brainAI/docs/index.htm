        There is no real documentation outside of the package itself. However, 
        the package itself, in the code, is pretty well documented. So it 
        shouldn't be that hard to figure out what exactly is going on. </font> 
    <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">The AI_Brain package is basically a package 
    that uses dictionaries for it's database of scripts, and messages to know 
    which ones to call and to receive instruction from those scripts. </font> </p>
    <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">At it's heart, the brain.src script is your 
    one true &quot;npc script&quot;. It includes an include which includes npc.em, and it 
    is the script which does all direct communication with the npc reference. It 
    is also generic enough that you should really never have to touch it for the 
    most part. It basically receives events from the npc object and uses those 
    to determine which scripts it will start off. Those scripts are started, and 
    the events appropriate to that script are passed along to it by the brain. 
    That script operates more or less independently, having received initially a 
    structure with the npc reference in it, and the event that started it off. 
    If you process events within that script, you will receive the events that 
    the brain is forwarding along to your script. In order to &quot;command&quot; the npc 
    to do things, your script usually includes npc_commands.inc. This is a set 
    of functions which basically packages up an event for each type of standard 
    npc.em function, and sends an event for each one off to the brain. The brain 
    processes these events, and executes the appropriate npc.em functionality.
    </font>
    </p>
    <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">That is a basic understanding of what it is 
    all about, and if you look at brain.src and the various include files when 
    appropriate, you should be able to see all of this taking place and put it 
    all together as to exactly how it is happening. The brain package is a 
    little less efficient than typical AI, and it can also run into problems if 
    the event queue's get clogged with messages. But it's true glory is in it's 
    generic encapsulation. With it, you can have a bunch of npc's that are very 
    similar except, perhaps, use different combat scripts, and all you have to 
    do is write the individual combat scripts, rather than having to re-write an 
    entirely new AI script. The old AI scripts could be approached similarly 
    once you understood the various nested includes, but they were far more 
    convoluted and difficult to follow than the brain's method. But also keep in 
    mind that seperate scripts offers the flexibility(and complexity) of doing 
    things relatively independently of having to worry about the main AI. So, 
    for instance, the brain will send combat events to the combat script, and 
    that is what will keep your npc fighting, following, etc, but it will still 
    also send speech events to the listen script. So your npc can be fighting, 
    and talking, at the same time, without having to include &quot;talking logic&quot; 
    within the combat code. With the standard AI, you would either have an NPC 
    that didn't speak while fighting, or one that had to have that code imbedded 
    not only in the main AI loop, but also the combat loop. With the brain AI, 
    the brain fires off events to the appropriate scripts, starting off the 
    scripts if necessary, and those scripts run independantly of one 
    another(unless you make them rely on each other for some reason, or in some 
    manner).</font></p>
    <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">While adding some overhead to AI in it's 
    pre-processing of events and multiple scripts to handle them, the brain 
    package does provide quite a bit of easy flexibility to make your npc a 
    little easier to manage.<br>

        Brain_AI is an &quot;AI system&quot; that is very different architecturally from 
        the current distro AI. So far as I understand, it is the only other 
        released AI system for POL, although undoubtably other people have 
        written their own from ground up and just not released them.</font><p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">
        It attempts, and often succeeds, at taking the highly convoluted and 
        complex task of operating your NPC's and makes that task into a fairly 
        modular approach. In doing so, it makes alot of things much easier and 
        even simply doable. </font> </p>
    <p><font face="Tahoma" size="2">You really have to probably pick it up for 
    yourself however and try it out. It can work fine right along side of the 
    distro AI, so you can just create a new NPC in npcdesc.cfg which uses the 
    brain_AI to control it. So give it a try is the best advice.<br>
