<b>.bcast [text]</b>

<u>Flags</u>
text - Optional. Text you wish to broadcast to all clients.

<u>Purpose</u>
The command .bcast is used to broadcast messages to all connected clients at once. This can be used in several ways.

By not giving any text to send, a gump will open asking you what you wish to broadcast. If you don't enter anything, it cancels the message.

Before it sends any message, it will ask you if you wish to send this under a different name. If you select Yes, you will be asked what name to send this message as. The name is sent at the beginning of any broadcast message. [name]: [message]. If none is entered here, it defaults back to your name.
