Changed:
	* GFSendGump()
	  This function will now tell the mobile if there were
	  any errors. Useful for determining if a gump has too
	  much data for the client to use.

	* ICP.cfg
	  Updated to correctly point to samplegump.src
	  Now compatable with the soon to be released new version
	  of the ICP/Control system.

Added:
	* GFWordWrap() to gumps_ex.inc
	  This function will take in a string of text and the maximum
          width each line should be in pixels and break it up into an
          array of strings. Can then be used with GFText* functions.

	* New include files 
	  - gumpprompt.inc
	  - yesno.inc
	  - requestgump.inc
	* Sample text commands
	  - gumpprompt.src
	  - yesno.src
	  - requestgump.src

Changed:
	* GFTextEntry()
	  Now has an additional optional parameter to specify 
	  where in the gump the data will be stored.

	* Assigned spaces to 9 pixels instead of 5.
