Distro Changelog 
Version MONDAIN: PHASE I.


Version MONDAIN
Rearranging everything: 
 Moved textcommands into a package. 
 Created packages for UOR,LBR,AOS. Each is a container package that contains other packages.
  This will allow people to switch between installs just be enabling the package for the 
  type they want. AOS is enabled by default. Any package that is the same between these
  three is in the package ALL rather than one of the above. Any package that changes
  depending on the install will be present in all three, but only one will be active at
  a time.

Make the save game interval readable from a cfg file.
Put the UOR houses back in.
