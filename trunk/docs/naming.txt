The rules below are here to make things easier for you. Although we cannot
enforce them, we encourage you to use them.


Directories:
----------------------------
	All the directories are lowercase.
	Underscores are allowed, though they are not encouraged.


Files:
----------------------------
	Acronyms/Initialisms are capitalized.
	Unless part of the above, the first letter of the filename is lowercase.
	The first letter of each additional word is capitalized.
	Extensions are lowercase.

	Examples:
		NPCBackpacks.inc
		newFiles.inc
		killAllPCs.src

	Exceptions:
		Config files, textcommands, and files in scripts/misc are all
		lowercase.
